## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Google Gemini API Key

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd job-scanner
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    You need a `.env.development.local` file in the root of your project containing your `GEMINI_API_KEY`. You have two options:

    **Option A: Create the file manually**
    Create the file and add your key:
    ```plaintext
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

    **Option B: Pull from Vercel (Recommended)**
    If you have already set up your environment variables in your Vercel project (see Deployment section), you can pull them to your local environment. This is the best way to keep variables in sync.
    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel # Install Vercel CLI globally if you haven't already
    vercel link          # Link your local project to your Vercel project
    vercel env pull .env.development.local
    ```
    This command creates the `.env.development.local` file for you.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The best way to run the project locally is with the Vercel CLI, as it accurately simulates the serverless environment.
    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
